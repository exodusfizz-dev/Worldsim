# Worldsim
Aiming to simulate global economics in reasonable detail, to use for an RPG irl. May expand to politics and country relations.

*Experimental*

Will start by attempting to simulate a single city: how resources move internally, and later imports and exports of the city; the industry and services exchanged; population's metrics in education, productivity of labour, discontent, various variables for access to basic services, quality of life and more; and flow of money and funding, especially for the local government.
Then expand this to a provincial level, then country. Will reconsider what to do next after this is complete.
Aiming to make an interactive website for players to input their actions as leaders of countries.
